# Submit Your Best Joke!(Beta)

Let’s be real — Operating Systems can be a bit dry. To keep things fun, we’re starting a **Joke of the Week** tradition!

Each week, you’re invited to submit your best (or worst!) joke. If it makes us laugh, groan, or quietly exhale through our nose, it might be featured at the end of recitation.
