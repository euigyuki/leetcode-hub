## 🧭 Office Hours Policy

To make the most of our limited time — and to help everyone develop strong problem-solving skills — please follow this guideline:

1. ✅ **Before attending office hours:**
   - Review the **Concepts** and **Assignment Help** sections on the course website.
   - Check the **FAQs** and course resources for common issues.
   - Try to isolate your problem or error — even partial understanding helps!

2. 🙋 **During office hours:**
   - Come with specific questions or error cases.
   - Be ready to walk through what you've already tried.
   - We’ll work together to get you unstuck — but the more you prep, the more you'll benefit!

3. 🚫 **Office hours are not for:**
   - Re-explaining the entire assignment specs
   - Debugging an entire PA from scratch
   - Questions already answered on the website

If you're not sure if your question fits — no worries! Come by anyway, and we’ll figure it out together.
