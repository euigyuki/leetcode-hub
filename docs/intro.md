# Introduction to Operating Systems

## What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware, enabling efficient and secure operation of the system.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Study Operating Systems?

Understanding operating systems is fundamental for computer scientists and engineers because:

- It provides insight into how computers work at a low level.
- It enables efficient and secure software development.
- It is crucial for system design, performance optimization, and troubleshooting.

## Key Functions of an Operating System

### Process Management
- Schedules and manages the execution of processes (programs in execution).
- Handles process creation, termination, and synchronization.

### Memory Management
- Allocates and deallocates memory space as needed by applications.
- Ensures safe and efficient use of system memory.

### File System Management
- Organizes, stores, retrieves, and manipulates files on storage devices.
- Manages permissions and access control for files and directories.

### Device Management
- Controls and coordinates the use of hardware devices (e.g., disks, printers, network interfaces).
- Provides device drivers for hardware abstraction.

### Security and Protection
- Protects system resources and user data from unauthorized access.
- Implements authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms.

### User Interface
- Provides user interfaces such as **Command Line Interfaces (CLI)** and **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)**.

## ðŸ§° Types of Operating Systems

- **Batch Operating Systems**: Execute batches of jobs with minimal user interaction.
- **Time-Sharing Operating Systems**: Allow multiple users to interact with a computer at the same time.
- **Distributed Operating Systems**: Manage a group of distinct computers and make them appear as a single system.
- **Embedded Operating Systems**: Designed for specialized devices like routers, smart TVs, and IoT devices.
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**: Guarantee response times for critical tasks, often used in industrial and embedded systems.
