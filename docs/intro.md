# Welcome to the Interview Workshop

This is a focused, collaborative space for students preparing for **technical interviews** — whether you're aiming for software engineering, machine learning, or research-based roles. The workshop is built to help you develop the problem-solving, communication, and system thinking skills needed to succeed.

## 🎯 What This Workshop Offers

- 📚 **Curated problem sets** organized by core concepts (e.g., sliding window, dynamic programming, graphs)
- 💬 **Mock interview opportunities** to improve articulation and confidence
- 🧠 **Discussions around tradeoffs, constraints, and design**
- 🛠️ **Hands-on coding practice** with real-time explanation and feedback

## 🧱 Structure

This site is organized by **concept**, not by week. You can work through problems in any order and revisit them as needed.

Each topic includes:
- 🔍 Concept overviews and patterns
- 🧩 Representative LeetCode problems
- ✅ Code templates and solution strategies
- 🎥 Optional recordings and walkthroughs (if available)

You’re encouraged to use this resource both during and outside of sessions.

## 👥 Who Is This For?

- Students preparing for internships or full-time roles in tech
- Anyone looking to strengthen their fundamentals in data structures and algorithms
- People who want structure and community while practicing

---

## 💡 How to Get the Most Out of It

- Solve at least one problem per concept before discussion sessions
- Bring questions or alternative solutions
- Write down edge cases and time/space complexity
- Practice articulating your reasoning — this matters more than just “getting the answer”

## 🧠 Guiding Principle

> “Interview success is built on fundamentals, clarity, and consistency.”

We’re here to build those — together.
