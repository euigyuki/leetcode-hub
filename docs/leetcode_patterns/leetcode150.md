#ðŸ“˜ How to Use the List Effectively

Track patterns: Instead of memorizing solutions, understand what type of problem it is.
Use templates: Have go-to templates for DFS, DP, binary search, etc.
Solve, then revise: Donâ€™t just move on â€” re-solve after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month (spaced repetition).
Group by pattern: e.g., solve 3 DFS/BFS problems in a row to master the technique.
