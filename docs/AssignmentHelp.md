## 🔁 General Advice

- **Start early** — OS assignments often require debugging time.
- **Test incrementally** — don’t write the whole thing before running your code.
- **Use the VSCode debugger** (see [Debugging Tips](#)) — it will save hours.
- Ask questions *after* you’ve tested basic functionality and reviewed the videos.

#### ✅ Before Asking for Help:
- [ ] My code compiles without errors.
- [ ] I’ve read the PA spec at least twice.
- [ ] I’ve watched the linked concept video(s).
- [ ] I ran my code with sample input and printed intermediate values.
- [ ] I looked at the FAQ/debug tips.
